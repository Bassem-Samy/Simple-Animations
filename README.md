# Simple-Animations
This is a project, where there's a class "AnimationsHelper" it's a static class that has the following functions to easily animate views using property animations
:
1- MoveVertically:  Moves  a view vertically by providing base and to points
2- animateHeight: animates height property for a view
3- animateHeightToFillParent: animate a child view to fill it's parent
4- moveUpToParent: moves an element vertically to the top of parent by providing the child and parent views
5-enterHorizontally: Moves a child element from side of the screen to center in parent
6- enterHorizontallyWithSlide : same as enterHorizontally but with a slide back animation (extra animation)

the good thing about these methods, is that you can simply animate a view inside it's parent by only providing that view, the parent view and the duration of animation
no need to implement translations or property animations, all is already made and you can modify the code to suit you more :)
